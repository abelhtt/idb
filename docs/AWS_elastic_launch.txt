How to restart the server through the AWS Console:
Make sure your region is set to N. Virgina 
Go to the Elastic Beanstalk tab in the console
There should be tab called Major
Navigate to it and in it there should be three tabs 
Environments
Application versions
Save configurations

Under Saved Configurations there should be a profile called
Production Site

Check the box and click load, should work


IF Save Config doesn't exist:
Go to Environments instead and launch a new environment

Select Web Server Environment
Start from: Predefined Configuration
Select Python from the list
Make sure it is the most recent version of Python 2.7
Next
If you are uploading a new version of the site then upload the necessary files in a zip.
That's basically it, you can skip past all the other steps, launch the environment
and confirm success.

If it works go to the Environments tab again and select the new environment you
just created. Then once there under Actions:
Slect save configuration.

That way we can just follow the first steps of this document.
