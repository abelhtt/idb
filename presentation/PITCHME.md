---

## What Did We Do Well?

- Everything |
  + (We can elaborate, we're not narcissistic we promise) |
- Coordination |
- Issue Tracking and User Stories |

+++

## Also, Google likes us
- Add screenshot for proof
- Or a live demo, but we should verify day-of

+++

## How Could We Improve?

- Working outside our roles |
- Make pages more interesting |
  + Animation, reworked content, etc |
- Make the front-end more beautiful |
- More data to display |

+++

## What Did We Learn From This?

- There are MANY components to big projects like this |
- Planning is ESSENTIAL |
- All the tools |
  + AWS,  | React,  | SQLAlchemy,  |
  + API Building... |
  + (You get the idea) |

+++

## What Puzzles Us?

- Amazon Lambda |
  + Thankfully we didn't use this |
- Elastic Beanstalk |
  + Adding servers breaks IPs |
- Why our peers dislike GitBook |
  + It worked just fine for us, like any other document editor |
