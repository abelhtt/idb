## How Could We Improve?

- More data to display |

+++

## What Did We Learn From This?

- There are MANY components to big projects like this |
- Planning is ESSENTIAL |
- All the tools |
  + AWS, React, SQLAlchemy, |
  + API Building... |
  + (You get the idea) |

+++

## What Puzzles Us?

- Amazon Lambda |
  + Thankfully we didn't use this |
- Elastic Beanstalk |
  + Adding servers breaks IPs |
- Why our peers dislike GitBook |
  + It worked just fine for us, like any other document editor |
